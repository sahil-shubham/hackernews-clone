# Backend Architecture and Database Overview

The backend is built using Next.js, leveraging its API Routes and Server Actions capabilities. Prisma serves as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, providing a type-safe and efficient data access layer.

## API Structure

The API design distinguishes between two main types of backend operations:

1.  **Stateful/Session-based Operations (Next.js API Routes):**
    *   Located in `src/app/api/`.
    *   **Authentication (`src/app/api/auth/`):** Endpoints for user registration, login, and managing user tokens (e.g., issuing JWTs stored in cookies).
    *   **Notifications (`src/app/api/notifications/`):** Endpoints for fetching user notifications, marking them as read, etc.
    
2.  **Core Application Logic (Next.js Server Actions):**
    *   Located in `src/app/actions/` (e.g., `replyActions.ts`, `voteActions.ts`).
    *   Server Actions are used for most of the core application functionalities like creating posts, submitting comments, and casting votes.
    *   **Direct Prisma Interaction:** These actions typically import the Prisma client directly and perform database operations.
    *   **Simplified Data Flow:** This approach allows Server Components to call these asynchronous functions directly, reducing boilerplate and the need for manual `fetch` calls for many CRUD operations.

This hybrid approach aims to use the most suitable Next.js feature for each type of backend taskâ€”API Routes for more traditional endpoint needs and Server Actions for streamlined data mutations and queries directly from components.

## Database (Prisma)

The primary data store is a PostgreSQL database, managed via Prisma.

*   **Schema Definition:** The database schema, including all models, fields, relations, and enums, is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
*   **Migrations:** Prisma Migrate is used to manage database schema changes over time, ensuring that the schema evolves in a consistent and trackable manner. Migration files are stored in `prisma/migrations/`.
*   **Prisma Client:** A type-safe database client is generated by Prisma based on the schema. This client is used throughout the backend (in API Routes and Server Actions) to interact with the database.
